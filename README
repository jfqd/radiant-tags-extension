This extension enhances the page model with tagging capabilities, tagging as in "2.0" and tagclouds.

== Requirements

This extension depends on the has_many_polymorphs plugin (included in vendor/plugins)
If you're still on Radiant pre-0.6.7, then the shards_extension should be installed and loaded first.
You can change the load order of extensions in config/environment.rb (see http://wiki.radiantcms.org/Using_the_Shards_Extension).

== Installation

=== Using RubyGems

`gem install radiant-tags-extension`

add the following line to your environment.rb
config.gem 'radiant-tags-extension'

=== Classic style

1. Copy the extension to your vendor/extensions directory as you would any other extension or use `script/extension install tags`
2. Run 'rake radiant:extensions:tags:install'
3. Make a page to sit in /search/tags/ (and it localized versions), and give it the "Tag Search" pagetype.
	 If you want to change this location, edit the routes file and the corresponding locale file(s).

Done!
Here's a sample results page to get you started:
	
	<r:search:empty>
	  <h2>I couldn't find anything tagged with "<r:search:query/>".</h2>
	</r:search:empty>

	<r:search:results>
	  <h2>Found the following pages that are tagged with "<em><r:search:query/></em>".</h2>

	  <ul>
	  <r:search:results:each>
	    <li><r:link/> - <r:author/> - <r:date/></li>
	  </r:search:results:each>
	  </ul>
	</r:search:results>
	
If you would like to show a tag-list on the sidebar this take this sample:

  <r:tag_cloud_list scope="/blog" />
  
Adding a pages tag-list and related pages:

<r:if_tagged>
<p>Categories: <r:tag_list /></p>
<p>
  <h2>Other pages with these tags</h2>
  <ul>
  <r:related_by_tags limit="5">
    <li><r:link /></li>
  </r:related_by_tags>
  </ul>
</p>
</r:if_tagged>

== Compatibility

=== VHost Extension

If you use the VHost-Extension place the following snippet inside of your vhost.yml file:

  MetaTag:
    id:
      scope:
        site_id
